# Quantum6G: Auto AI Advanced Quantum Neural Networks with 6G Technology
Quantum6G is an automatic artificial intelligence library that combines quantum computing and 6G technologies to build advanced quantum neural networks. It provides a high-level interface for constructing, training, and evaluating quantum neural networks. This library was developed by [Emirhan BULUT](https://linkedin.com/in/aiemir).

## Installation
To install the Quantum6G library, simply run the following command: 

```
pip install quantum6g
```

## Getting Started
Here is a simple example to get started with the Quantum6G library:

``` 
from quantum6g import Quantum6G
import numpy 
```

## Create a quantum neural network

``` quantum_6g = Quantum6G() ```

## Build the model
``` quantum_6g_model = quantum_6g.build_model(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test) ```

## Evaluate the model
``` 
accuracy = quantum_6g_model.evaluate(X_test,y_test)[1]
print("Accuracy: {:.2f}%".format(accuracy * 100)) 
```
