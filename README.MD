Quantum6G is an automatic artificial intelligence library that combines quantum computing and 6G technologies to build advanced quantum neural networks. It provides a high-level interface for constructing, training, and evaluating quantum neural networks. This library was developed by [Emirhan BULUT](https://linkedin.com/in/aiemir).

## Installation
To install the Quantum6G library, simply run the following command: 

```
pip install quantum6g
```

## Getting Started
Here is a simple example to get started with the Quantum6G library:

``` 
from quantum6g import Quantum6G
import numpy 
```

## Create a quantum neural network

``` quantum_6g = Quantum6G() ```

## Build the model
``` quantum_6g_model = quantum_6g.build_model(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test) ```

## Evaluate the model
``` 
accuracy = quantum_6g_model.evaluate(X_test,y_test)[1]
print("Accuracy: {:.2f}%".format(accuracy * 100)) 
```
