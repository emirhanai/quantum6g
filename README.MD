Quantum6G is an automatic artificial intelligence library that combines quantum computing and 6G technologies to build advanced quantum neural networks. It provides a high-level interface for constructing, training, and evaluating quantum neural networks. This library was developed by Emirhan BULUT.

## Installation
To install the Quantum6G library, simply run the following command: 

```
pip install quantum6g
```

## Getting Started
Here is a simple example to get started with the Quantum6G library:

``` import quantum6g ```

## Create a quantum neural network

``` model = quantum6g.Quantum6G(num_qubits=2)) ```

## Train the model
``` model.fit(X, Y, weights, steps=100, learning_rate=0.1) ```

## Evaluate the model
``` 
accuracy = model.evaluate(weights, X)
print("Accuracy: {:.2f}%".format(accuracy * 100)) 
```
